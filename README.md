***Going live date: 23rd March 2020***

## Are you a volunteer group who needs this tool to help organise your efforts?

***It is technically possible NOW to support the entirety of the UK with this tool, but we must scale the platform carefully for security concerns. The database associated with this tool contains vulnerable people's data, and not just everyone can access it.***

If you want to use this tool with your Volunteer group, please visit http://selfisolationhelp.co.uk/volunteers , thank you. 

### Supported Locations as of 21st of March 2020:

- Richmond, Greater London
- Kingston, Greater London

More coming soon...

## This project is accepting Pull Requests

**Developers:** We are accepting pull requests (you just don't have access to the database). Please help contribute. If you are working with volunteer groups, please see the above message about how you can get them on the platform.

Thank you

## Getting set up

* Install Ionic CLI using `npm install -g @ionic/cli`
