THIS TOOL IS NOW OPEN SOURCE.

This project was originally used to help self isolators in need during the covid pandemic.

Please feel free to use for your own projects, all we ask is that you credit when you can.

Please bear in mind that the codebase at the time of writing is 4 years old and can benefit from the dependencies being updated together with the node version.
